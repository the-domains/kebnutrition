Food is not just for sustenance; it is an opportunity to nourish your body, to provide it with the essential nutrients it needs to perform at its optimum.

Hi. I'm Kathryn Baker.

I am a Registered Dietitian both here in the UK and in the United States.

I received my education at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, and completed my training and certification in 2008\. 

My passion for the nutrition field began in my teens, after a developing awareness of food and its link to health.

I learned early on that food could mean the difference between feeling ill and feeling well.

From our daily energy
levels to the development of chronic diseases, our food choices can make a
valuable impact.

Get in touch, and let my guidance make the difference in your life.

There is a wealth of information on food, nutrition, and health, and with so much of it being misinformation, misleading, or misinterpreted, navigating it can leave you feeling overwhelmed and discouraged.
